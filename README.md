- 👋 Hi, I’m @mawid6 (mawi or chipbite)
- 👀 I’m interested in software architecture, development practices (TDD), software project collaboration, facilitation, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to best do pragmatic architecture for multiple teams across an enterprise. How do we get a consistent view of how we explain what we do?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on techniques for capturing a software architecture to support everything from onboarding to product management, in an economical and maintainable way.
